= Deploy to AWS

All of our applications are deployed into a https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] cluster running in AWS. We use https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] to write our account and application infrastructure which, when deploying most applications, consists of Kubernetes config files, Route 53 entries, and IAM policies/roles.

== Architecture Overview

All traffic coming into kubernetes cluster goes through an NLB that points to a https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx[NGINX Ingress Controller] pod running in the cluster. Part of deploying an application is creating an https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[ingress] that causes the NGINX Ingress Controller to update it's config then and route traffic to the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[service] associated with a pod. When a public URL is defined (part of our deployment modules, which we'll discuss below), a Route 53 entry is created that points to the NLB.

We use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html[AWS Parameter Store] to store application secrets.

== Deployment guide
=== Requirements
* A text editor
* Have the https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html[Terraform CLI installed]
* Have AWS API credentials configured/saved. You can do this by https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html[installing the AWS CLI] and running `aws configure`
** For BYU employees, we have https://github.com/byu-oit/awslogin[a tool] to help us to log into our AWS accounts. Install it and run `awslogin`.

=== Write Infrastructure
We have https://github.com/byuoitav/terraform[a few modules] to simplify most of the code for a deployment. The main decision you need to make is whether your application needs _permanent_ storage or not. If it does, you'll use the https://github.com/byuoitav/terraform/tree/master/modules/kubernetes-statefulset[Kubernetes StatefulSet] module. If not, you'll use the https://github.com/byuoitav/terraform/tree/master/modules/kubernetes-deployment[Kubernetes Deployment] module. They are pretty much the same, but the `StatefulSet` module adds additional options regarding storage ("Storage" in this case is an EBS Volume). This guide will create a `StatefulSet`, but creating a `Deployment` is pretty similar. You can learn more about https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployments] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/[StatefulSets] in Kubernetes' concepts documentation.

For the `av-control-api`, all of the terraform for the core API, as well as the driver servers, is in `terraform/main.tf`. If you are trying to deploy a different application, you should create a `terraform` folder at the root of the repo, with a `main.tf` file in it.

In every terraform configuration, you need to add the following block to tell terraform where it should https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html[store and load infrastructure state]:
[source,terraform]
----
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket     = "terraform-state-storage-586877430255" // <1>
    lock_table = "terraform-state-lock-586877430255" // <1>
    region     = "us-west-2"

    key = "SOME-UNIQUE-KEY.tfstate" // <2>
  }
}
----
<1> These values come from BYU's configuration https://github.com/byuoitav/aws/blob/master/s3_backend.tf[here]. They *_will_* be different if you are deploying to a different AWS account.
<2> Replace `SOME-UNIQUE-KEY` with something unique across all terraform configurations deployed into your account.

After configuring the terraform backend, you need to set up the `aws` the `kubernetes` providers. For the kubernetes provider, the cluster endpoint is required, so we have stored the value in AWS Parameter Store. We'll talk more about pulling values from AWS Parameter store below.
[source,terraform]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

data "aws_ssm_parameter" "eks_cluster_endpoint" {
  name = "/eks/av-cluster-endpoint"
}

provider "kubernetes" {
  host = data.aws_ssm_parameter.eks_cluster_endpoint.value
}
----

Next, we'll pull any secrets that your application requires from AWS Parameter Store. To put a secret into Parameter Store:

. Log into AWS
. Go to `Systems Manager`
. Select `Parameter Store` on the left sidebar
. Click `Create Parameter`, and enter the name/value of the secret.
** If the secret will be used by _multiple_ applications, prefix its name with `/env/`
** If the secret will _only be used by your applications_, prefix its name with `/env/<application-name>/`

Once all of your secrets are in Parameter Store, pull all the required values into terraform by using blocks like these:
[source,terraform]
----
data "aws_ssm_parameter" "secret_name" {
  name = "/env/<application-name>/<secret-name>"
}
----

Now that you have all of your secrets, you can use our terraform modules to create your application.
[source,terraform]
----
module "ui_prd" {
  source = "github.com/byuoitav/terraform//modules/kubernetes-statefulset"

  // required variables
  name                 = "<application-name>" // <1>
  image                = "docker.pkg.github.com/byuoitav/ui/ui"
  image_version        = "v0.5.0"
  container_port       = 8080 // <2>
  repo_url             = "https://github.com/byuoitav/ui"
  storage_mount_path   = "/opt/ui" // <3>
  storage_request_size = "25Gi"

  // optional variables
  image_pull_secret = "github-docker-registry" // <4>
  public_urls       = ["roomcontrol.av.byu.edu"] // <5>
  container_env     = { // <5>
    DB_USERNAME = data.aws_ssm_parameter.db_address.value
  }
  container_args = [ // <6>
    "--port", "8080",
    "--log-level", "2",
    "--some-path", "/opt/ui",
    "--some-secret", data.aws_ssm_parameter.secret_name.value
  ]
  ingress_annotations = { // <7>
    "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout" = "3600"
  }
}
----
<1> Put `-dev` at the end of name if this is the dev version of it.
<2> The port that your application runs on.
<3> Where the EBS volume will be mounted. This option and `storage_request_size` are not present for a deployment.
<4> This is the name of a https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line[kubernetes secret] of type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. This is only required if you are pulling an image from a private docker registry.
<5> A list public hosts to reach your application. If left empty or omitted, the application will only be accessible from within the cluster.
<6> Defines environment variables for your application.
<7> Defines arguments passed to your application.
<8> Annotations added to the Kubernetes Ingress, which will affect the NGINX configuration. See options https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/[here].

=== Deploy To AWS
Once you have written your terraform configuration, you need to initialize it by running:
[source,bash]
----
terraform init
----

You only need to do this once, or if you ever add any new modules or providers. Finally, have terraform create the resources you have defined by running:
[source,bash]
-----
terraform apply
-----
