= Hardware Set Up Guide

For the purpose of this demo we will be setting up a single display room that is controlled by a raspberry pi running the AV-API. The raspberry pi will act as the room's control system and be able to control the input being shown on the display as well as the volume of the display. For this demo you will need the following materials:

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B]
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/[7-inch Rapsberry Pi Touch Panel]
* An IP controllable display (one which we xref:hardwareList.adoc[have already written a driver for])
** For demonstration purposes we will be using a https://www.sony.com/electronics/televisions/xbr-x800g-x805g-x807g-series[Sony XBR 800G]

This guide will go over how to get the hardware set up so it is functional. It will go over:

- Assembling the Pi
- Wiring the System
- configuring the flat panel

==== Assembling the Pi

Here is a pretty good video of how to assemble the raspberry pi and the touch screen.

You may also want to have a keyboard and mouse connected to the Pi as well.  It's easier to get up and running this way.  However, later in this guide we will share a way to enable ssh on the pi before your first boot.  This will allow you to configure the pi remotely without the need for the local keyboard and mouse.

==== Wiring the System
image::wiring.jpg[Wiring]
As shown above the wiring for this room is pretty straight forward.

- Have network cables running from a nework switch to the raspberry pi and the Sony Flat Panel Display. This will put the Raspberry Pi and the Flat Panel on the same network for them to communicate.
- Have three devices (shown in the drawing as computers) that can act as video source devices. Connect these three devices to the Flat Panel. 
. We will be using HDMI 1-3 on the TV for this guide.

==== Configuring the flat panel

In order for the pi and the flat panel to cmmunicate with each other, the flat panel needs to first be configured in a particular way. Here are the steps for the configuration.

. Go to Home -> Settings -> Network -> Home Network
.. Renderer: On
.. IP Control -> Authentication -> Normal -> Normal and Pre-shared key
.. Enter a Pre-shared Key of: "AVAPI"
.. Simple IP Control -> On
. Go to Home -> Settings -> Network
.. Remote Start: On
. Home -> Network Settings -> IP Settings
.. Static
.. Enter IP Address
.. Enter Gateway
.. Enter Network Prefix length
.. Enter DNS 1 and DNS 2
