= Quick Start

This Quick Start guide in intended to help you get a test environment up and running using the av-control-api to communicate with devices in your classroom. The project, and this guide, uses Docker to distribute pre-compiled microservices.  Docker makes it easy to containerize, distribute, and update our systems. You are of course able to pull down the repositories, compile the binaries, and launch the microservices in any way that works for your environment.  But feel free to use the already packaged Docker containers ditributed as part of the project. For additional information about Docker please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[Docker's Docs].


== Demo Solution

For the purpose of this demo we will be setting up a single display room that is controlled by a Raspberry Pi computer running the AV-API. The raspberry pi will act as the room's control system and be able to control the input being shown on the display as well as the volume of the display. For this demo you will need the following materials:

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B]
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/[7-inch Rapsberry Pi Touch Panel]
* An IP controllable display (one which we xref:hardwareList.adoc[have already written a driver for])
** For demonstration purposes we will be using a https://www.sony.com/electronics/televisions/xbr-x800g-x805g-x807g-series[Sony XBR Series Television (XBR-800G)]

This setup guide will help you get your first room up and running. It uses the av-control-api for control and Demo UI. *_Please Note: The UI was created for the purposes of this demo only, it is not code we intend for use in a production environment_*  

The guide is broken down into the following sections:

. Getting the hardware set up
. Getting the Raspberry Pi OS ready
. Downloading/starting the code (in the form of docker containers)
. Setting up the database and configuring your devices and room
. Testing the API
. Using the UI
. Exploring BYU's Implementation

== Getting the hardware set up

There are only three hardware components for this setup: the Raspbery Pi, a touchscreen and the television.  The TV will need a little configuration to enable it's network API.  Please follow the xref:hardwareSetup.adoc[Hardware Setup Guide] for more instructions.

== Getting the OS ready

To get the Operating System ready to go for this solution you need a raspberry pi with the following installed on it:

* Raspbian Lite
* Docker
* docker-compose
* Chromium Web Browser
* i3 Window Manager (minimal windowing envrionment for launching chromium)

For a detailed step-by-step guide to get these installed on your raspberry pi, please refer to the xref:OS.adoc[Complete OS Setup Guide]

== Downloading and Starting Necesary Docker Containers

In order to get the Pi up and running to control the sample room, the following containers are needed:

. couch-db (for configuration storage)
. av-api (base api engine)
. sony-control-microservice (sony adcp protocol translation service)
. Demo UI

We will be using docker-compose to get the required containers up and running on your pi. Please refer to the documentation in xref:startAPI.adoc[Deploying Docker Containers] for more detailed steps on how to use docker-compose to get these containers on your device.


== Setting up the database and configuring your devices

We use CouchDB as the database for our solution. Within CouchDB there are five important tables that are used throughout our solution:

. devices
. device_types
. rooms
. buildings
. room_configurations

The exact documents required for this demo are available by running the python script found in xref:DemoDBScript.adoc[Demo DB Script].

For a more detailed documentation on the content of each of these tables, their purpose, and how they relate to each other, 
please refer to the xref:DB.adoc[Complete Database Guide]

== Testing the API

Once you have followed the previous steps, you should be set to begin testing the API. Attempt to hit the API endpoints using a program like
Postman. If it is successful then you have successfully set up your pi to control the devices in your room. For more detailed documentation
on how to test the API enpoints please refer to the xref:API.adoc[Complete API Testing Guide]

== Using the UI

Now that you have the AV-API to control your room, you need an interface to use to interact with it. We have created a simple user interface that can act as an example to how you might implement an interface of your own. *_Please Note: This interface was created only for the purposes of this demo, it is not code we use in a production environment_*  

For information on how the UI works click xref:UI.adoc[here].

== Exploring BYU's Implementation

Now that you have a high level understanding of how everything is connected, there are countless ways to implement this solution for your organization. If you would liek to learn more about how Brigham young University has implemented this solution on their campus go xref:byuArchitecture.adoc[here].
