=== device_type
The device_type database contains information about a type of devices (whereas the devices database contains info about a specific instance of a device).
This Database is important because it contains info on what commands are available for the device, and what microservices and endpoints are used
in the use of these commands.

<1> These fields are identical to the fields mentioned in detail in previous examples.
<2> `+"roles"+`: The roles of the device, described in detail in previous examples.
<3> `+"commands"+`: The list of commands that can be sent to this device.
<4> `+"_id"+`: the unique identifier for the command.
<5> `+"description"+`: for your own use to save info about the command.
<6> `+"microservice"+`: The info for the microservice used in making the command.
<7> `+"_id"+`: the unique identifier for the microservice.
<8> `+"description"+`: for your own use to save info about the microservice.
<9> `+"address"+`: is where the microservice is running including the port it is running on.
<10> `+"endpoint"+`: The API endpoint on the microservice that corresponds to the command.
<11> `+"_id"+`: is the unique identifier for the enpoint.
<12> `+"description"+`: for your own use to save info about the endpoint.
<13> `+"path"+`: is the path to the endpoint.
<14> `+"priority"+`: This is used to help determine which events are more important and need to be executed first.
